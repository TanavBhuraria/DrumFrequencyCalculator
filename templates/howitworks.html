  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on the physics of vibrating membranes, specifically calculating the fundamental frequency of a circular drumhead using a theoretical model based on wave mechanics and Bessel functions. It merges mathematical physics, acoustics, and practical application in instrument design and tuning.
  </p>

  <h2>Formula Used</h2>
  <p>The fundamental frequency <strong>F</strong> of a circular membrane is given by:</p>
  <pre><code>F = (v / 2πr) × √(T / μ)</code></pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>F</strong>: Fundamental frequency (Hz)</li>
    <li><strong>v</strong>: A vibration mode constant (explained below)</li>
    <li><strong>r</strong>: Radius of the drumhead (meters)</li>
    <li><strong>T</strong>: Tension applied to the membrane (N/m)</li>
    <li><strong>μ</strong>: Surface mass density of the membrane (kg/m²)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This formula gives a first-order estimate of the pitch produced when the drumhead is struck, assuming uniform tension and material properties.
  </p>

  <h2>Where This Comes From</h2>
  <p>
    The drumhead is modeled as a 2D circular membrane fixed along its boundary. When struck, the membrane vibrates radially according to the 2D wave equation in polar coordinates. The general solution includes Bessel functions, particularly:
  </p>
  <pre><code>Jₙ(x)</code></pre>
  <p>
    The lowest natural mode of vibration, or the fundamental mode, occurs when the Bessel function <code>J₀(x)</code> first equals zero. The first zero of <code>J₀</code> is roughly <strong>2.405</strong>. This value determines the constant <code>v</code> in the frequency formula:
  </p>
  <pre><code>v ≈ 2.405</code></pre>
  <p>
    Thus, the formula relies not only on the radius and tension but also includes a constant based on the shape of the vibration.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tension <strong>T</strong> increases wave speed and raises pitch.</li>
    <li>Surface mass density <strong>μ</strong> adds inertia and lowers pitch.</li>
    <li>Radius <strong>r</strong> affects wavelength; larger drums vibrate slower.</li>
    <li>Constant <strong>v</strong> represents the mathematical boundary behavior of circular membranes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The square root term represents wave speed, while the <code>v / 2πr</code> term adjusts it based on geometry.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions & Simplifications</h2>
  <p>This model effectively provides a foundational estimate. However, real drums can behave more complexly. The following assumptions are made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The membrane is perfectly circular and uniformly tensioned.</li>
    <li>Edges are fully fixed, with no rim slippage.</li>
    <li>Only the fundamental vibration mode is calculated.</li>
    <li>No energy loss occurs through air damping or shell vibration.</li>
    <li>The membrane material is uniform in density.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These assumptions simplify the creation of a clear mathematical model, avoiding complex simulations or empirical adjustments.
  </p>

  <h2>What You Enter</h2>
  <p>You provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The radius of your drumhead</li>
    <li>The applied tension (in N/m)</li>
    <li>The surface density (mass per area) of your drumhead material</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Based on this information, the calculator returns the estimated frequency in Hz of your drum's fundamental pitch.</p>

  <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
  <p>This tool can assist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drum makers in designing for specific pitch ranges</li>
    <li>Musicians in tuning their drumheads more accurately</li>
    <li>Physics students in relating theory to sound</li>
    <li>Researchers in validating theoretical models through audio tests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Component</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently working on an extended research project where I:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyze real drumheads of different sizes and materials</li>
    <li>Measure physical parameters (radius, tension, density)</li>
    <li>Use this calculator to predict frequency</li>
    <li>Record and analyze the actual frequency using audio software (like Audacity or Logic Pro)</li>
    <li>Compare predicted values with actual results</li>
    <li>Investigate causes of error and refine the model if necessary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The full research paper and measurement methods will be added below once finalized.
